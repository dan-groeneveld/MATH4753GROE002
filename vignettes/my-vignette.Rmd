I have chosen 4 functions from my package to upload for this assignment. myci, which creates a confidence interval for the population mean for a given set of data, mycltdangroeneveld, which returns a plot of the distribution of the sum of uniforms, myboot2dg, which creates a confidence interval for the population mean for a given set of data by iterating subsets of a sample and calculating these samples means, and dansample, which creates sample distributions for 10 equally likely events and plots a specified number of these samples at a given time interval.
